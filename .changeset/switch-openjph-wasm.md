Switch HTJ2K codec from `@cornerstonejs/codec-openjph` to `openjph-wasm`, which correctly round-trips multi-component (volumetric) HTJ2K data. The cornerstone build silently dropped components 2..N on decode; `openjph-wasm` handles arbitrary component counts losslessly.

Also adds true z>1 multi-component chunk support: z-planes are now encoded as components of a single codestream rather than one plane per chunk. Exports `Htj2kPlane` from the package index.
