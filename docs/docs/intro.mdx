# Introduction

This project is a TypeScript implementation of the [SpatialData](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/) library.

It is a collaborative effort by the [Taylor CCB Group](https://github.com/Taylor-CCB-Group) at the Center for Human Genetics, Oxford University and the Gihlenborg Group at the Harvard Medical School - Department of Biomedical Informatics.

The approach taken to the design is to follow the structure of the original library, adapting it to TypeScript with the intention that it should be familiar to users of the original library and aligned with best practices in frontend development.
