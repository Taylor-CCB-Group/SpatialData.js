# Introduction

This project is a TypeScript implementation of the [SpatialData](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/) library.

It is a collaborative effort by the [Taylor CCB Group](https://github.com/Taylor-CCB-Group) at the Center for Human Genetics, Oxford University and the Gihlenborg Group at the Harvard Medical School - Department of Biomedical Informatics.

The approach taken to the design is to follow the structure of the original library, adapting it to TypeScript with the intention that it should be familiar to users of the original library and aligned with best practices in frontend development.

There are several packages that aim to facilitate the use and development of this functionality:

## `@spatialdata/core`

This is a vanilla-JS library that should provide a reasonably lightweight, clean and efficient way of loading data from SpatialData stores, which in principle should reflect the functionality of the Python library.


## `@spatialdata/react`

React hooks for SpatialData. This package should have a minimal set of dependencies, such that it should be easy to integrate into other React applications. It is mostly focused on providing react-idiomatic ways of accessing the data itself, with appropriate abstractions around the core vanilla API, managing the `async` nature of fetching data etc.


## `@spatialdata/vis`

High-level React-components and deck.gl layers for visualising SpatialData. This package is explicitly less stable and more experimental than the related `core` and `react` packages - the dependency on the `viv`/`deck.gl`/`luma.gl` stack means that installing it into an app (particularly one that already uses anything from this ecosystem) entails a certain amount of care around potential conflicts or breaking changes between versions.

It is hoped that it will be robust and of a high quality, but especially at the early stage of development, the goal is not to have a lean bundle size, guarantees of API stability between releases, etc.

It is used to provide working examples for displaying in the `docs` site, as well as a sample app primarily for prototyping while developing features.
